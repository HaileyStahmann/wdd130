        Hi, I’m Hailey and I love plants! I wanted to create a website to collect all the best information, tips and tricks for helping people become better plant caretakers. Disclaimer, this is not a form of official diagnosis for your plant, but a way for you to self-treat and get to know your plant better.  This is my personal collection of plants and what I have learned about them along the way. I hope you find this information useful, interesting and helps your plants thrive. Join the community and spread the love for houseplants!
