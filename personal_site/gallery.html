          <h3>Snake Plant</h3>
          <h4>(Dracaena trifasciata)</h4>
          <p>The snake plant is a hardy, low-maintenance houseplant with long, upright leaves that are typically green with yellow or white edges. Its architectural form and air-purifying qualities make it a popular indoor plant. With minimal care, snake plants can thrive for many years and even propagate easily from leaf cuttings.</p>
          <h5>Care Tips:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Light: Snake plants can tolerate a range of lighting conditions, from bright, indirect light to low light. However, they thrive best in moderate to bright indirect light.</li>
              <li>Watering: Snake plants are drought-tolerant and prefer to dry out between waterings. Overwatering is a common mistake, so allow the soil to dry completely before watering again. During the winter, reduce watering.</li>
              <li>Temperature: They prefer warmer temperatures 65°F-85°F (18°C-29°C) and should be kept away from cold drafts.</li>
              <li>Soil: Use well-draining, sandy soil. A cactus or succulent mix works well.</li>
              <li>Fertilizing: Feed the plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer once during the growing season (spring to summer) but skip during the winter.</li>
              <li>Repotting: Snake plants grow slowly and only need repotting every 2-3 years or when they outgrow their pot.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Thimble Cactus</h3>
          <h4>(Mammillaria gracilis)</h4>
          <p>Also known as the Powder Puff Cactus, this is a small, spherical cactus that is native to Mexico. It’s famous for its delicate, white spines that give it a soft, fluffy appearance, resembling a thimble or a puffball. In the spring, it produces clusters of small, vibrant flowers, usually in shades of pink, red, or yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. The Thimble Cactus is perfect for cactus enthusiasts and beginners alike due to its low maintenance and unique appearance. With proper care, it can thrive for many years and produce beautiful blooms in the right conditions.</p>
          <h5>Care Tips:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Light: Thimble cacti prefer bright, direct sunlight. Aim for at least 4-6 hours of sun daily. Without enough light, the cactus may become elongated and lose its compact, rounded form.</li>
            <li>Watering: Like most cacti, the Thimble Cactus is drought-tolerant and does not need frequent watering. Water it thoroughly when the soil has completely dried out. During the growing season (spring and summer), water every 1-2 weeks, and reduce watering in the fall and winter when the plant is dormant.</li>
            <li>Temperature: Thimble Cactus thrives in warm temperatures between 70°F-100°F (21°C-38°C). It can tolerate higher temperatures, but it’s sensitive to cold and should be kept away from drafts or temperatures below 50°F (10°C).</li>
            <li>Soil: Use well-draining cactus or succulent mix to avoid waterlogging. You can also add sand or perlite to regular potting soil to improve drainage.</li>
            <li>Fertilizing: Feed the cactus with a diluted, balanced fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing during the dormant winter months.</li>
            <li>Humidity: Thimble cacti prefer low humidity levels, typical of desert environments. Keep them in a dry spot to prevent rot and fungal issues.</li>
            <li>Repotting: Thimble cacti have slow growth, so they don't require frequent repotting. Repot only when the plant outgrows its pot, typically every 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>Spines: Be careful when handling the cactus, as its spines are sharp and can easily poke you. Wear gloves or use tongs to handle the plant if necessary.</li>
