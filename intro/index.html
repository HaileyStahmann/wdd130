        <p>
          I am currently majoring in Web Design and Development and minoring in
          Horticulture. I am also almost done completing a certificate in
          Graphic Design. I hope to be able to make a career for myself using a
          combination of web design, development, and graphic design.
          Additionally, I am certified in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
        </p>

          I have a love for Graphic Design in particular but chose to persue it
          as a certificate rather than a major because I felt I needed to study
          web development and design in more depth.
